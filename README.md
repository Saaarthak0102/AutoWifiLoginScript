# AutoWifiLoginScript
This script and the batch and vbs file was made especially for logging into my college's wifi system. This script and the batch and vbs file was made especially for my college, which uses a login system for wifi. They hire Sophos which regulates the login and logout. Now the Sophos client has to be started and takes up quite the memory as it is always on as a background process. So this script stores your Wifi credentials and when executed it automatically logs you into the Sophos Login Portal. It also tells you that your data limit has been exceeded and your credentials cannot be used for logging in. 

The code uses the AWT in Java to send notifications to inform you if the you are logged in or if you're data is exhausted completely in which case login failed.

To use this In-Campus,

1. Download the code file as zip and extract it.
2. Make sure you have Java on your WINDOWS machine(no cross compatibility for now).
3. Enter your WiFi Login Credentials where they are mentioned.
4. Execute the "runLogin.vbs" file from the run menu or the terminal, or just simply click it.
5. The program will execute and show you a notification pop-up if you have been connected successfully or the login has failed.

I think that will be it!!

Thank You for visiting.
